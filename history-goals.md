    <h5>Our Goals and Values</h5>
    <p>GeWoNN brings together language and reading researchers working on the German language and provides a forum for discussing research-specific questions and improvements in the field. We value openness, honesty, fairness, and inclusivity, and hope to attract members interested in improving reading research, and academia more generally.</p>

##### Modus Operandi

We welcome members from all stages of their research career, especially Early Career Researchers. We aim to be inclusive: There are no inclusion or exclusion criteria for membership. Communication happens via Discord and Zoom. The language of communication is approximately 80% English and 20% German, and not all of the current members are German speakers. Anyone who self-identifies with the goals and values of GeWoNN is free to <a href="/join">join us</a>. Once you join, you are encouraged to introduce yourself in the Discord channel “intros”. 

The activities of GeWoNN include (but are not limited to) monthly journal clubs, the organisation of symposia, and joint research projects. On Discord, anyone is welcome to promote relevant events, share resources, ask questions relating to word nerd research, propose symposia, solicit feedback, or search for collaborators. Especially early career researchers are encouraged to actively participate in the discussions. Senior researchers are asked to refrain from posting in the “ECR-space” channel unless they have been tagged to answer a specific question.

##### <a href="/coc">Code of Conduct</a>

We welcome anyone who would like to join us, and we expect respectful and professional behaviour from the side of all members. We reserve the right to exclude participants who do not adhere to the code of conduct from the Discord channel. If you have any concerns about anyone’s behaviour, please contact our mediators.
