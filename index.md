GeWoNN is a network of researchers interested in language and reading in the German language. GeWoNN's members are spread across multiple European institutions, and meet to discuss research-specific questions and improvements in the field. We value openness, honesty, fairness, and inclusivity, and hope to attract members interested in improving reading research, and academia more generally.
